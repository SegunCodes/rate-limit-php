### RateLimit using PHP and Redis cache

The rateLimit function establishes a connection with Redis using the Redis PHP extension.

1. The client's IP address is retrieved using $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].

2. A unique key is generated based on the client's IP address to store the request count.

3. The current request count for the IP address is fetched using $redis->get($key).

4. If the request count doesn't exist or has expired, it is initialized to 1, stored in Redis using $redis->set(), and given an expiration time using $redis->expire().

5. If the request count exists, it is incremented using $redis->incr().

6. The code checks if the request count exceeds the maximum allowed requests. If so, it returns an error response (HTTP status code 429) and exits.

7. If the rate limit is not exceeded, the code proceeds with normal execution and outputs "Request processed successfully."

Remember to update the Redis server details ($redis->connect()) to match your Redis server configuration.

If you prefer to use Memcached instead of Redis, you can replace the Redis-related code with the appropriate Memcached functions. The overall logic will remain the same, but the method names and syntax will differ for Memcached usage.
