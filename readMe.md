### RateLimit using PHP and Redis cache

# IP-Based rate limit
The rateLimit function establishes a connection with Redis using the Redis PHP extension.

1. The client's IP address is retrieved using `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`.

2. A unique key is generated based on the client's IP address to store the request count.

3. The current request count for the IP address is fetched using `$redis->get($key)`

# Endpoint-based rate limit
The endpointRateLimit function takes the maxRequests (maximum allowed requests within the timeWindow) and timeWindow (duration in seconds for rate limiting) as arguments.

1. We retrieve the endpoint or route path from the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` superglobal variable.

2. We create a unique key for the endpoint using the $key variable.

3. We create a unique key for the endpoint using the $key variable.



4. We connect to Redis using the Redis class and the appropriate connection details.

5. If the request count doesn't exist or has expired, it is initialized to 1, stored in Redis using $redis->set(), and given an expiration time using $redis->expire().

6. If the request count exists, it is incremented using $redis->incr().

7. The code checks if the request count exceeds the maximum allowed requests. If so, it returns an error response (HTTP status code 429) and exits.

8. If the rate limit is not exceeded, the code proceeds with normal execution and returns an output

Remember to update the Redis server details ($redis->connect()) to match your Redis server configuration.

If you prefer to use Memcached instead of Redis, you can replace the Redis-related code with the appropriate Memcached functions. The overall logic will remain the same, but the method names and syntax will differ for Memcached usage.
